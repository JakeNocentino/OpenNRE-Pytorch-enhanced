# OpenNRE-PyTorch-enhanced
A version of OpenNRE-Pytorch specifically designed for my summer REU project at Lehigh University.

Much of the code in this repo is from the original OpenNRE-PyTorch repo at https://github.com/ShulinCao/OpenNRE-PyTorch. In the case of my code, it is redesigned to deal with a binary classification task.
